# Privacy Policy for Apex Browser

**Last Updated:** February 1, 2026

At Apex Browser, we believe your browsing history is your business, not ours. This Privacy Policy explains how Apex Browser ("we", "our", or "app") handles your data.

## 1. Data Collection

**We do not collect, store, or share your personal data.**

*   **Browsing History:** Your browsing history, cookies, and cache are stored locally on your device using standard Apple WebKit APIs. We do not have access to this data.
*   **Search Queries:** Your search queries are sent directly to the search engine you select (e.g., Google, DuckDuckGo). We do not intercept or log these queries.
*   **Ad Blocking:** Our ad blocker works entirely on-device using Apple's Network Extensions framework. No comparisons or filter lists are sent to external servers.

## 2. Third-Party Services

*   **Websites You Visit:** Any website you visit may collect your data in accordance with their own privacy policies. Apex Browser provides tools (like ad and tracker blocking) to help limit this collection, but we cannot control the content of third-party sites.

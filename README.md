![Apex Browser Icon](apex_icon_concept.png)

Apex Browser brings true desktop power to your iPad with a stunning "Liquid Glass" interface. It replaces the traditional mobile layout with a powerful Sidebar Command Center, giving you full control over your tabs, multitasking, and privacy.

## 🚀 Features

### Sidebar Command Center
Forget the top bar. Apex uses a vertical sidebar to manage your web life efficiently.
*   **Vertical Tabs:** View full page titles and scroll through dozens of open tabs without losing your place.
*   **Favorites Grid:** Pin your essential sites to the top of the sidebar for one-tap access.
*   **Drag & Drop Organization:** Drag tabs to reorder them, pin them, or instantly create a split view.

### True Split View Multitasking
Experience multitasking that feels native and powerful.
*   **Dual-Web View:** Drag any tab onto another to open them side-by-side instantly.
*   **Workflow Ready:** Perfect for researching while writing, watching videos while browsing Reddit, or comparing prices.
*   **Independent Navigation:** Each side acts as a full browser instance.

### System-Level Ad Protection
Apex doesn't just hide ads; it stops them at the network level.
*   **Native Ad Blocking:** Built using Apple's advanced Network Extensions to block ads before they load.
*   **Tracker Prevention:** Stops invisible scripts from following your activity.

### Engineered for iPad Pro
*   **Desktop User Agent:** Forces websites to load their full desktop versions, not mobile sites.
*   **Hardware Keyboard Support:** Full support for iPad keyboard accessories.
*   **Dark Mode:** A deep, immersive dark theme.
